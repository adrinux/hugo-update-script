# hugo-update-script
A shell script to update to the latest version of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static web site generator.

Forked from [dkebler's Gist](https://gist.github.com/dkebler/1188d098d62166fdc6065fb2658a71dd).

Changes from dkebler's version:

1. Work on any Linux distro (original was limited to systems with the 'arch' command).
